    <h1><b><center>Causes of Global warming</center></b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Global warming or climate change refers to a broad array of environmental degradation that is predicted to result from increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, including global warming, alterations in precipitation, sea level changes and more extreme weather events.
        There are many causes of climate change, both natural and anthropogenic. Natural causes include changes in the sun’s intensity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth’s orbit.
        Anthropogenic causes include deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and agricultural practices. The most significant cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Burning these fuels releases CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the Earth’s temperature to rise.
        Deforestation is another major cause of climate change. Trees absorb CO2, so cutting them down decreases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Deforestation also decreases the Earth’s ability to reflect sunlight, which further contributes to global warming.
        While the causes of climate change are varied, the most significant cause is human activity. To combat climate change, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by changing our energy sources and practices.
        Likewise, the tech industry contributes to climate change through its energy-intensive operations, including data centers, manufacturing processes, and electronic waste generation. The use of fossil fuels to power data centers and other infrastructure leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2).Data centers and server infrastructures consume vast amounts of electricity to operate and cool the servers. This high energy demand results in significant CO2 emissions, particularly if the energy sources used are predominantly fossil fuels.
